					<p>The following translation of these verses appeared in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Poems from the Old Bards</i>, by Taliesin, Bristol, 1812:</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">
						<p>
							<span>“In Soar’s sweet valley, where the sound</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Of holy anthems once was heard</span>
							<br/>
							<span>From many a saint, the hills prolong</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Only the music of the bird.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>In Soar’s sweet valley, where the brook</span>
							<br/>
							<span>With many a ripple flows along,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Delicious prospects meet the eye,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The ear is charmed with <i>Phil’mel’s</i> song.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>In Soar’s sweet valley once a Maid,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Despising worldly prospects gay,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Resigned her note in earthly choirs</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Which now in Heaven must sound alway.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>In Soar’s sweet valley David preached;</span>
							<br/>
							<span>His Gospel accents so beguiled</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The savage Britons, that they turned</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Their fiercest cries to music mild.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>In Soar’s sweet valley Cybi taught</span>
							<br/>
							<span>To haughty Prince the Holy Law,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The way to Heaven he showed, and then</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The subject tribes inspired with awe.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>In Soar’s sweet valley still the song</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Of Phil’mel sounds and checks alarms.</span>
							<br/>
							<span>But when shall I once more renew</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Those heavenly hours in Gladys’ arms?”</span>

					<p>“Taliesin” was the pseudonym of an amiable clergyman, the Reverend Owen Thomas, for many years curate of Llantrisant. He died in 1820, at the great age of eighty-four. His original poetry in Welsh was reputed as far superior to his translations, and he made a very valuable and curious collection of “Cymric Antiquities,” which remains in manuscript in the keeping of his descendants. <a href="chapter-3.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
